# easy-timecard-app

This project is for a no-code time card app that allows users to easily clock in and out, tracking their work hours. It's intended for both individual professionals and organizations looking to manage work hours efficiently. The app should offer functionalities such as user registration and login, a dashboard for a quick overview of total and recent work hours, as well as weekly or monthly summaries. Additionally, it should allow users to manually adjust their clock-in and clock-out times if necessary. The design should be intuitive and straightforward, facilitating ease of use and accessibility for all users. Importantly, the project should be editable in a no-code environment, allowing for hassle-free updates and customizations post-launch.
